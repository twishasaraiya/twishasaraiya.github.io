This blog is in continuation to my previous post about software engineering experience after working for 1 year. If you havent read it already please do check it out [here](https://twishasaraiya.github.io/5-simple-tips-to-become-better-software-developer/).

Audience: 2+ years of experience

Goal: Lessons learned in 2nd year

## Lesson 1: Understand the impact of your work

You have successfully completed a feature and it is working perfectly in production Wohooo!! ü•≥ But at this point did you stop and consider what is the impact that is delivered. For example: Did you ask "How many people is this going to help?". This is very much in correlation to [Lesson #1](#lesson-1)  

## Lesson 2: Understanding the buisness requirement and what are the current pain points

So far we worked on a feature, even optimized it, tested it and released to production. But did we realise why this requirement came in the first place? What was it that was missing earlier or causing productivity issue to the end user? If you asked these questions before developing or taking up the task, that is great üëè. If you haven't so far, then you should start approaching and understanding the problem in the first place. Why do it? This will help you to have a holistic view and you can contribute back to the lifecycle by coming up with a better approach or an enhanced feature that might be very useful. For example: I would understand, why do we need this feature? How is it going to be used ? How is it working currently without this feature?  What are the current pain points. This helped me later in situations where I could identify the problem/pain-point and suggest/propose a solution for the same. Many of my proposed solutions helped bolster the engineering productivity of the team at Quantiphi and got widely accepted.

## Lesson 3: Looking at the bigger picture(the arch) + Maitainibility

In the beginning of this year, I realised that writing code is far much easier than maitaining the quality of that code over a period of time. This becomes specially difficult when you want to move fast and deliver features. You should revisit the code and ask
 - Can we do better? 
 - How can we decouple it?
 - Have we documented the known issues?

I realised that **Refactoring** the code is an important part of maintainibility
I would highly recommend 
 - Visit this [website](https://refactoring.guru/)
 - Read Clean Code. You can find my review of the same [here](https://twishasaraiya.github.io/write-clean-code/)  

While working on very specific picture, you tend to loose the idea about how it is all connected?. Some of the questions that you can start asking and train yourself with
  - What happens when I call another service ?
  - How are these linked together ? 
  - How are they deployed? 
  - What cloud components are being used ?
  - Why this is used vs why not something else? 
  - Why is it deployed this way vs What if we deployed it here ? (For example: As a serverless function)

Basically, all I am trying to say is that the goal should be to 
  - Look and understand the bigger picture
  - Ask questions about the tradeoffs made
  - 

## Lesson 4: Soft Skills - Clear Communication

## Lesson 5: Burnout + Constant Producitivity

I know so far I have talked a lot of soft skills.
