At the end of 2020, I started exploring golang to expand the breadth of my knowledge. These blogs were initially just personal notes which I took while reading some docs, podcasts or other blogs. Some of the blogs are based on the projects I did as well. I decided to put them on my blog page so that I could come back and refer it or someone else might find it useful as well
