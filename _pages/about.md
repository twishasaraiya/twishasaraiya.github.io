Hi there,

Glad to see you here. I am Twisha Saraiya, currently working as a **Software Developer** at [Quantiphi Inc](https://www.quantiphi.com/) in Mumbai. I specifically work as a part of Conversational AI team to deliver virtual assitants for various industries and use cases. I have experience building various developer productivity tools and microservices to reduce the delivery time of projects in our team. I mostly work with technologies like Nodejs, express, angular, jest, python and CI/CD.

I completed my engineering from Thadomal shahani engineering college in Mumbai in 2019. In college I have participated in various coding challenges. I was one of the head technical member of the TSEC codecell. I helped conduct semi-weekly workshops and coding contests to help students strengthen their data structure and algorithmic skills. Besides I am open source lover and deep learning enthusiast. 

In my free time, I explore new open source projects or read some paper in the NLP space. My interests lie in NLP, Speech recognition, developer productivity and machine learning platforms. I have been awarded Facebook PyTorch Scholarship for- Deep Learning Nanodegree (top 300 people in world) and
Reinforcement Learning ( top 100 from Deep Learning Nanodegree).
